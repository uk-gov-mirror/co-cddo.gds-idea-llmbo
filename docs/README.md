# LLMbo - Large Language model batch operations

AWS Bedrock offers powerful capabilities for running batch inference jobs with large language models. 
However, orchestrating these jobs, managing inputs and outputs, and ensuring consistent result structures can be arduous. 
LLMbo aims to solve these problems by providing an intuitive, Pythonic interface for Bedrock batch operations.

Additionally, it provides a method of using batch inference for structured responses, 
taking inspiration from the likes of [instructor](https://pypi.org/project/instructor/), 
[mirascope](https://pypi.org/project/mirascope/) and [pydanticai](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-ai/). 
You provide a model output as a pydantic model and llmbo creates takes care of the rest.

See the AWS documentation for [models that support batch inference.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-supported.html)

The library includes built-in adapters for the following model families:

| Adapter | Models | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| `AnthropicAdapter` | Claude (Anthropic) | Native tool use |
| `MistralAdapter` | Mistral / Mixtral (legacy prompt injection) | JSON extraction from text |
| `MistralFunctionAdapter` | Mistral / Mixtral (function calling) | Native tool use |
| `OpenAIAdapter` | OpenAI-compatible models | Native tool use |
| `DeepSeekAdapter` | DeepSeek | Native tool use |
| `QwenAdapter` | Alibaba Qwen | Native tool use |
| `LlamaAdapter` | Meta Llama 3 / 4 | JSON extraction from text |
| `NovaAdapter` | Amazon Nova (Converse API) | Native tool use |

Adapters are auto-selected at runtime based on the model ID you pass to `BatchInferer`.
Other models may be supported through the default adapter, or you can write and register your own
(see `src/llmbo/adapters/base.py`).


## Prerequisites 

- A `.env` file with an entry for `AWS_PROFILE=`. This profile should have sufficient 
permissions to create and schedule a batch inference job. See the [AWS instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-permissions.html)
- [A service role with the required permissions to execute the job.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-permissions.html#batch-inference-permissions-service), 
- A s3 bucket to store the input and outputs for the job. S3 buckets must exists in the same region as you execute the job. This is a limitation of AWS batch inference rather that the 
package.
    - Inputs will be written to `f{s3_bucket}/input/{job_name}.jsonl`
    - Outputs will be written to `f{s3_bucket}/output/{job_id}/{job_name}.jsonl.out` and 
      `f{s3_bucket}/output/{job_id}/manifest.json.out`


## Install
```bash 
pip install llmbo-bedrock
```

## Getting started

Here's a quick example of how to use LLMbo:

### BatchInferer
```python
from llmbo import BatchInferer, ModelInput

bi = BatchInferer(
    model_name="anthropic.claude-v2",
    bucket_name="my-inference-bucket",
    region="us-east-1",
    job_name="example-batch-job",
    role_arn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/BedrockBatchRole"
)

# Prepare your inputs using the ModelInput class, you also need to include an id 
# input Dict[job_id: ModelInput ]

inputs = {
    f"{i:03}": ModelInput(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Question {i}"}]
    ) for i in range(100)
}


# Run the batch job, this prepares, uploads, creates the job, monitors the progress 
# and downloads the results
results = bi.auto(inputs)
```

### StructuredInferer
For structured inference, simply define a Pydantic model and use StructuredBatchInferer:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from llmbo import StructuredBatchInferer

class ResponseSchema(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    confidence: float

sbi = StructuredBatchInferer(
    output_model=ResponseSchema,
    model_name="anthropic.claude-v2",
    # ... other parameters
)

# The results will be validated against ResponseSchema
structured_results = sbi.auto(inputs)
```
